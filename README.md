## Rainbow Hotel HABBENING!!!<br>
It's Habbening boyz!
Currently uses Dialogic for dialogue, func-godot for maps and maybe other shit to be listed here later. Remains to be seen if i'll be using DragonBones plugin
for portrait anims. Eh.

## LICENSE SHITE BELOW!<br>
Code is MIT to play nice with all the shit i use addon wise. Besides, why not?<br>
All assets(textures, music, models etc), however, <b>belong to me</b> and you're forbidden from using them in your own commerical projects. Make your own, lazy bones.<br>
<br>
The Exception to this is, of course, if you just want to make a fan game based on my game or some shit. Then you can use the assets but have to do it non-comercially.<br>
But hey, I doubt this will happen at all, fan games I mean.
